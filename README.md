# About me
Hello my name is Logan Jenison.  I am currently a junior at the University of Central Florida.  I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science but am taking IT classes as well as I am interested in this field of studies. 
Taking these classes I believe will only benefit me and expand my knowledge pertaining to my field of studies.
